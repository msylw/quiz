Simple tool for creating quizzes. Simple touch-friendly interface,
(thanks to bootstrap should work with PC, smartphone, tablet etc).

Uses django and bootstrap, check representative licences.

Django has to be available on system before use, bootstrap is included.

Usage:
cd quiz                    # to where manage.py is
python manage.py syncdb    # create db
# when asked create admin account

python runserver

* Open browser, go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin
* Login using data entered above

* Create template, enter name and template content, example:
From {{question.0}} to {{question.1}}

* Add some Proposals (possible answers) below, ex:
Yes
No

* Order index is used to sort the entries in particular order later.
  Value provides value for each answer

* Create experiment, use the above template, example question:
north
south

* User questions below are asked before the actual quiz (this is for things 
  like user age etc)

* Make sure experiment is active

* Go to http://localhost:8000 The new experiment should appear. 

Play a little more, and you can figure out the rest.
